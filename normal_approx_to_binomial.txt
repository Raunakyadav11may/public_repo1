u --> mean
o --> standard deviation
n --> no. of trials
p --> probability of success

u=np

probability=mean/no. of trials

mean = probability*n trials

to use normal distribution to approximate probability related to binomial distribution , n has to be sufficiently large -->

np >=5
n-np >=5

what is normal distribution ?

eg. a coin lands head 45 times out of 100 ; there are 2 ways of denoting -->


using binomial distribution
x=45
using normal distribution with continuityt correction
44.5<X<45.5


Suppose we want to know the probability that a coin lands on heads less than or equal to 43 times during 100 flips.

In this situation we have the following values:

    n (number of trials) = 100
    X (number of successes) = 43
    p (probability of success on a given trial) = 0.50


step1.
verify sample size is large enough to use normal approx.

np=100*.5=50
n-np=100-100*.5=50

both of them are greater than 5

step2.
determine continuity correction

according to what they have specified,
x<=43  

x<43.5  --> continuity corrected

step3.
find mean and standard deviation

u=np =100*.5=50
o=sqrt(np(1-p))=5

step4.
find z-score

z=(X-u)/o

z=43.5-50 /5=-1.3

step5.
find cumulative probability

=.0968
